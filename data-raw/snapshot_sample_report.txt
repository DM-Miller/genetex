TMB-High 






COMMENT: 
In our laboratory, Skin cancer, non-Melanoma harbors a median of 15 variants in 
our panel. This case, with a TMB count of 46, scores in the 98th percentile 
across all cancer types and in the 99th percentile in the subset of Skin cancer, 
non-Melanoma. 

TEST INFORMATION: 
This test utilizes a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology called 
Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP [1]) for single nucleotide variant (SNV), 
insertion/deletion (indel), and copy number detection in genomic DNA using the 
ArcherDx platform and Illumina NextSeq next generation sequencing (NGS). 
Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated from a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor 
specimen (after histological review for tumor enrichment), blood, bone marrow 
aspirates, or pancreatic cyst fluid. The genomic DNA was enzymatically sheared, 
end-repaired, adenylated, and ligated with a half-functional adapter. A 
sequencing library targeting hotspots and full exons was generated using two 
hemi-nested PCR reactions. Illumina NextSeq 2x150 base paired-end sequencing 
results were aligned to the hg19 human genome reference using Novoalign [2]. An 
ensemble variant calling approach, using MuTect1 [3], LoFreq [4], GATK [5, 6, 
7], and a laboratory developed hotspot caller, was applied for SNV and indel 
variant detection. A laboratory developed copy number caller utilizing a 
coverage distribution from a panel of normals was applied for copy gain and loss 
detection. Variants are reported with Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) 
protein and DNA nomenclature, followed by the referenced Ensembl transcript ID. 
This test has been validated to detect SNV and indel variants at 5% allelic 
frequency or higher in target regions with sufficient read coverage. 

TMB (tumor mutational burden) is reported as a total absolute count across the 
covered regions of the assay. The count is determined by quantitating the number 
of somatic mutations in sequenced genes on this panel. Somatic mutations are 
defined as all intronic, synonymous and non-synonymous variants present with 
allele frequencies between 5-95% that are not present in a panel of normal cases 
after excluding low quality variants and technical artifacts (by base quality 
metrics), and including variants supported by a minimum number of reads and 
prioritized variant calling methods. We determined that an absolute TMB count 
greater than or equal to 15 shows 96.8% concordance with identification of a 
TMB-high status in orthogonal assays. In high quality/high tumor purity samples, 
we determined the precision of the absolute TMB count to be 98%. We also provide 
a summarized "TMB-high" or "TMB-low" interpretation and the tumor type-specific 
historic rank of the absolute TMB count in each case relative to a reference 
population assessed with this assay. Disclaimer: TMB estimation based on 
mutation counting in targeted panels may not reflect the tumor mutational burden 
determined by other assays (e.g., whole exome sequencing). Direct conversion of 
the reported absolute TMB count to other assays or standards is not possible. 

The assay shows the following limitations for copy number calling: (1) 
aneuploidy cannot be distinguished from gene specific copy gains or copy losses, 
(2) limited sensitivity for borderline/weak copy gains or copy losses, (3) 
limited sensitivity in specimens with low tumor cellularity, (4) limited 
performance in poor quality specimens showing suboptimal coverage, and (5) 
absolute copy number status cannot be determined.
