Description: GENETEX is a Natural Language Processing pacakge for patient registries. It's primary function 
    is to provide a series of functions to augment data abstraction of genomic reports encountered in 
    routine clinical practice. It provides a simplified workflow allowing users to copy relevant text and pdf 
    files and run functions that either directly import data into REDCap or create a csv file that can later
    be imported
